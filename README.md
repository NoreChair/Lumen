 [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

 Lumen is a Vulkan ray tracing framework that contains a variety of variance reduction techniques. Its aim is to accelerate some of the well-known rendering techniques in computer graphics literature with the help of the ray tracing hardware in modern GPUs. All the techniques Lumen implements run fully on the GPU.

## Features
 ### Rendering Techniques

 - Unidirectional Path Tracer with Multiple Importance Sampling (Path)
 - Bidirectional Path Tracer (BDPT)
 - Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping (SPPM)
 - Vertex Connection and Merging (VCM)
 - Primary Sample Space Metropolis Light Transport (PSSMLT)
 - Combined VCM + MLT Integrator (VCMMLT)
 - ReSTIR
 - ReSTIR GI
 - ReSTIR PT / GRIS
 - DDGI (Real time)
 - FFT Convolution Bloom

### Engine
 - Lambertian, mirror, glass, glossy and optionally Disney BSDF
 - Spot (point), polygonal and directional lights
 - JSON-based scene system
 - Modified Mitsuba parser
 - A lightweight Vulkan abstraction layer from scratch
 - EXR output (F10)
 - On-the-fly RMSE computation
 - SPIRV reflection
 - Render graph support with experimental Vulkan features
   - Automatic resource and synchronization management
   - Binding inference based on shader reflection results
   - Simple builder pattern

 ### About experimental features
 With the recently integrated render graph, Lumen uses some of the more experimental Vulkan features. These are namely,
  - Templated push descriptors (may be problematic with AMD)
  - Event-based syncronization (via syncronization2 API, available from Vulkan 1.3)
    - Experimental feature, may not work depending on your driver (May need Vulkan beta drivers on Nvidia)
    - Enabled via `use_events` flag in the Render Graph settings. (See `RenderGraphSettings` in `RenderGraphTypes.h` and `RayTracer.cpp`)

## Building

To build Lumen, start cloning the repository with

```shell
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yuphin/Lumen.git
```
### Requirements
- Vulkan SDK
- Turing+ or RDNA2 GPU
- CMake 3.4 or above (Credits to [@Lachei](https://github.com/lachei) for porting the project to CMake and testing it on Linux)


## Usage
Some of the sample scenes can be found in the `scenes/` directory.
Sample scene files with various integrators can be found in the `scenes/cornell_box/` directory.

To load a scene file simply run:
```shell
Lumen.exe <scene_file>
```

## Getting started with Lumen
The best way to get started is to take a look at the unidirectional path tracer implemented in [src/Raytracer/Path.cpp](https://github.com/yuphin/Lumen/blob/master/src/RayTracer/Path.cpp) and gradually explore the other integrators. From there, you can focus on the related shaders that are located in the `src/shaders` folder.
